Bio:
Iâ€™m a freelance writer, analyst, advisor and public speaker on advanced data technologies and emerging IT. For 20 years at PwC's R&D and innovation think tanks, I identified emerging technologies on the cusp of adoption, assessed their business impacts, and advised PwC's C-suite clients on innovation strategy.
